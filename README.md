# Real-time-License-plate-Recognition
This project implements a Real-Time Automatic License Plate Detection System using Python and OpenCV. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects vehicle license plates, extracts the plate region, and segments individual alphanumeric characters from the plate.

This forms the foundation of ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) systems used in:
- Traffic monitoring & enforcement
- Toll collection systems
- Parking automation
- Security & surveillance applications
